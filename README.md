# blobcatchers
Small web game idea that was made while I was bored. Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible while collecting blobs that are falling at increasing speeds. 
Use keyboard arrow keys to move your character from left to right.

Features:
- Larger blobs will regenerate more health if you are able to catch them
- Larger blobs will do more damage if you fail to catch them in time
- Game keeps track of time survived, updates high score
